# Testing Exercises 

## Description
This exercise aims to put into practice essential knowledge about testing in Java, 
using tools like JUnit 5, AssertJ, and the TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology.

Through guided and progressive exercises, you will learn to:
- Properly organize a Java project with Maven or Gradle, including the necessary 
dependencies for testing.
- Write and run unit tests with JUnit 5 to verify the behavior of classes and methods.
- Use AssertJ to write clear, precise, and expressive assertions.
- Apply the TDD cycle (test, implementation, refactoring) in the development of 
basic features.
- Write modular and testable code, clearly separating business logic from 
input/output details.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: IIn this exercise, we will introduce the world of automated testing through 
a practical example.
Additionally, we will introduce parameterized tests with JUnit 5, a very useful 
technique for validating the same functionality with different sets of data.
Finally, we will cover throwing and detecting exceptions in Java. The goal is to 
understand how to manage expected errors through automated testing.

Level 2: In this level, we will learn how to use AssertJ, a testing library that 
allows us to write more expressive and readable assertions than traditional JUnit 
assertions.

Level 3: In this exercise we will work with Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build 
a stateful calculator step by step.
This approach will help us understand how writing one test at a time allows us to 
better model the classes and ensure their proper functionality.
This way, we will learn how to apply the Red → Green → Refactor cycle to design a 
class iteratively, starting from the requirements expressed in each test.

## Features
- Set up Java projects with Maven or Gradle for testing.
- Write unit tests with JUnit 5.
- Write expressive assertions with AssertJ.
- Apply the TDD cycle (test, implementation, refactoring).
- Separate business logic from input/output to make code testable.
